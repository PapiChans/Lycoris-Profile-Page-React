        `Chisato's pistol is confirmed to be based on the Tokyo Marui Strike Warrior Gas BlowBack airsoft pistol. The gun itself is based on the Detonics CombatMaster, a modified version of the Colt 1911 with a specialized close-quarters combat compensator`,
        `Despite her non-lethal rounds being referred to as "rubber bullets" in the anime, they have the visual effect of pepper spray projectiles. These rounds can also fit into Takina's pistol.`,
