    trivia: [
        `Chisato's pistol is confirmed to be based on the Tokyo Marui Strike Warrior Gas BlowBack airsoft pistol. The gun itself is based on the Detonics CombatMaster, a modified version of the Colt 1911 with a specialized close-quarters combat compensator`,
        `Despite her non-lethal rounds being referred to as "rubber bullets" in the anime, they have the visual effect of pepper spray projectiles. These rounds can also fit into Takina's pistol.`,
        `Chisato is the only character in the series that requires a mechanical prosthesis in place of an actual organ to continue living.`

When operating as a Lycoris, she wears her red 1st Lycoris uniform, which is a red and grey pleated dress, paired with black calf-high socks and brown loafers. When working at Café LycoReco, she wears a red samue with dark blue and lime-green accents, a dark blue kimono skirt, and a beige apron wrapped around her waist. She also wears an Alan Institute pendant around her neck at all times.`,
